So, when it comes to giving out prizes, we have a special fondness for challenges and activities that are GitHub-related. For instance, if a student creates an amazing &quot;My Octocat drawing&quot; or comes up with a super &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; use of GitHub, that&#39;s the kind of stuff that gets rewarded with prizes. We&#39;re all about celebrating creativity and innovation within the GitHub community!</li><li>More ideas to give away prizes: <ul><li><strong>GitHub Scavenger Hunt</strong>: Create a scavenger hunt where participants must navigate through GitHub repositories, find hidden clues, or complete coding challenges to win prizes.</li><li><strong>GitHub Bingo</strong>: Design GitHub-themed bingo cards with tasks like &quot;Fork a repository,&quot; &quot;Create a pull request,&quot; or &quot;Star a project.&quot; Participants can mark off these tasks as they complete them and win prizes for completing a row or column.</li><li><strong>GitHub Profile Makeover Contest</strong>: Encourage participants to revamp their GitHub profiles, including customizing their README files and adding unique features. Prizes can be given to the most visually appealing or informative profiles</li><li><strong>GitHub Karaoke</strong>: Organize a GitHub-themed karaoke night where participants rewrite popular songs with GitHub-related lyrics and perform them. Prizes can be given for the most entertaining performances.</li></ul></li><li>When it comes to handing out T-shirt codes as prizes, it&#39;s a great idea for Campus Experts to give the code directly to the lucky winner. This way, the winner gets to pick the T-shirt size and style that suits them best. It&#39;s all about making sure they get a T-shirt that they&#39;ll love and wear with pride!</li></ul>',3);function w(y,z){const r=s("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),h("div",null,[g,t("p",null,[e("For more information, please head over to the "),t("a",m,[e("The GitHub Shop"),i(r)]),e(" website.")]),f,t("p",null,[e("When you are submitting the "),t("a",b,[e("request form"),i(r)]),e(' on the Event Issue, make sure to add "yes" to "Are you requesting prizes for the event" and check the items you prefer in the checkboxes.')]),v])}const k=o(c,[["render",w],["__file","prizes.html.vue"]]);export{k as default};
