It brings together leaders from different regional communities to hang out, become friends, learn from each other&#39;s mistakes and successes, and solve shared problems.</p><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Motivation</h2><p>Separate communities frequently co-exist in a shared region. They know of each other, but they don&#39;t collaborate or talk to each other much. If they do, they would benefit from doing it even more.</p><p>Their relationship tends to be underdeveloped for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Members of each communities&#39; committee/organizing team don&#39;t know each other</li><li>They don&#39;t frequently communicate. Unlike their peers in their own community, they don&#39;t see each other in classes every day.</li><li>Kicking off, and then sustaining inter-community collaboration efforts is a hard task.</li><li>There is not enough opportunity to maintain inter-community friendships over time.</li></ul><p>Field Day can help improve some of these problems. At the very fundamental level it represents a place for student leaders across communities to spend time together, which will improve their relationships.</p><h2 id="what-s-an-unconference" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-an-unconference" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What&#39;s an unconference?</h2><p>To quote the google definition:</p><blockquote><p>A loosely structured conference emphasizing the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants</p></blockquote><p>There are two key points to what an unconference is in the context of Field Day:</p><ol><li>It&#39;s (largely) unstructured - there is no CFP. Topics of discussion can be decided on the day.</li><li>The content itself is decided and provided by the attendees on the day.</li></ol><p>There are two reasons why the unconference format works well for Field Day:</p><ol><li>Since attendees decide the content, it is timely, relevant, and represents what they want to talk about.</li><li>This rather loose structure carries a much smaller organizational burden than a full conference.</li></ol>',14),p=e("br",null,null,-1),m={href:"http://githubfieldday.com/sf2017/#schedule",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=i('<h2 id="what-s-a-student-leader" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-a-student-leader" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What&#39;s a student leader?</h2><p>A student leader is someone who&#39;s actively involved in improving their local technical community. They might be the president or chairperson of their school&#39;s tech club or be one of the organizers of the annual hackathon. They might run the student hardware group or be actively involved in introducing other students to programming.</p><p>All student leaders are potential Campus Experts.</p><h2 id="why-is-github-doing-this" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-github-doing-this" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why is GitHub doing this?</h2><p>GitHub is on a mission to empower student developers. Technical student communities are a proven and effective way for student developers to find empowerment. Field Day helps leaders of those communities to be even more effective.
