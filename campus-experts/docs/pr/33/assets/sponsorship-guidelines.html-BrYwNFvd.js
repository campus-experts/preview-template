This is due to the follow reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>The money isn&#39;t unlimited</strong>. We need to work together to use the Campus Expert budget well, so that it goes as far as possible, and helps as many students as possible.</li><li><strong>Dependence on GitHub</strong>. If you rely solely on us for funding, and don&#39;t develop relationships with other sponsors, you are eventually going to run into problems when you need more than we can provide.</li><li><strong>Reduced opportunities</strong>. New sponsors bring new technology, new jobs, and new opportunities into your communities. By limiting yourselves to GitHub, your community loses out on diverse opportunities.</li><li><strong>Careful spending</strong>. It&#39;s easy to get complacent when money is too easily available. Costs start to creep up and quotes are less competitive.
