In order to ensure that prizes are sent out to as many communities and events as possible, we have setup a limit of <strong>5 total prizes per event.</strong> You may select mutliple prizes, but the total cannot exceed five. If you put Mona Figurines and T shirt codes as your prizes, and you chose 5 as the amount you need, you will get three figurines and two shirts, or vice versa. Help us by indicating the specific numbers for your prizes in the event description. You can find tips on how to use your prizes effectively among a large audience below.</li></ul><h2 id="guidelines-for-awarding-prizes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#guidelines-for-awarding-prizes"><span>Guidelines for awarding prizes</span></a></h2><ul><li>We love celebrating all things GitHub! So, when it comes to giving out prizes, we have a special fondness for challenges and activities that are GitHub-related. For instance, if a student creates an amazing &quot;My Octocat drawing&quot; or comes up with a super &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; use of GitHub, that&#39;s the kind of stuff that gets rewarded with prizes. We&#39;re all about celebrating creativity and innovation within the GitHub community!</li><li>More ideas to give away prizes: <ul><li><strong>GitHub Scavenger Hunt</strong>: Create a scavenger hunt where participants must navigate through GitHub repositories, find hidden clues, or complete coding challenges to win prizes.</li><li><strong>GitHub Bingo</strong>: Design GitHub-themed bingo cards with tasks like &quot;Fork a repository,&quot; &quot;Create a pull request,&quot; or &quot;Star a project.&quot; Participants can mark off these tasks as they complete them and win prizes for completing a row or column.</li><li><strong>GitHub Profile Makeover Contest</strong>: Encourage participants to revamp their GitHub profiles, including customizing their README files and adding unique features. Prizes can be given to the most visually appealing or informative profiles</li><li><strong>GitHub Karaoke</strong>: Organize a GitHub-themed karaoke night where participants rewrite popular songs with GitHub-related lyrics and perform them. Prizes can be given for the most entertaining performances.</li></ul></li><li>When it comes to handing out T-shirt codes as prizes, it&#39;s a great idea for Campus Experts to give the code directly to the lucky winner. This way, the winner gets to pick the T-shirt size and style that suits them best. It&#39;s all about making sure they get a T-shirt that they&#39;ll love and wear with pride!</li></ul>',5);function v(w,y){const i=o("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),l("div",null,[m,e("p",null,[t("For more information, please head over to the "),e("a",g,[t("The GitHub Shop"),r(i)]),t(" website.")]),f,e("p",null,[t("When you are submitting the "),e("a",z,[t("request form"),r(i)]),t(' on the Event Issue, make sure to add "yes" to "Are you requesting prizes for the event" and check the items you prefer in the checkboxes.')]),b])}const k=a(c,[["render",v],["__file","prizes.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/getting-started/prizes.html","title":"Prizes","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"date":"2023-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Prizes","description":"What kinds of prizes available and how to use them"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Types of prizes available","slug":"types-of-prizes-available","link":"#types-of-prizes-available","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"How to request prizes?","slug":"how-to-request-prizes","link":"#how-to-request-prizes","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Limits to Prizes","slug":"limits-to-prizes","link":"#limits-to-prizes","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Guidelines for awarding prizes","slug":"guidelines-for-awarding-prizes","link":"#guidelines-for-awarding-prizes","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1731640720000,"contributors":[{"name":"Arman Moztarzadeh","email":"armanmoztar@outlook.com","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"getting-started/prizes.md"}');export{k as comp,x as data};
