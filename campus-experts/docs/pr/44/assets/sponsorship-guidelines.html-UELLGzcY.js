This is due to the follow reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>The money isn&#39;t unlimited</strong>. We need to work together to use the Campus Expert budget well, so that it goes as far as possible, and helps as many students as possible.</li><li><strong>Dependence on GitHub</strong>. If you rely solely on us for funding, and don&#39;t develop relationships with other sponsors, you are eventually going to run into problems when you need more than we can provide.</li><li><strong>Reduced opportunities</strong>. New sponsors bring new technology, new jobs, and new opportunities into your communities. By limiting yourselves to GitHub, your community loses out on diverse opportunities.</li><li><strong>Careful spending</strong>. It&#39;s easy to get complacent when money is too easily available. Costs start to creep up and quotes are less competitive. This will harm future Experts as less budget will be available.</li></ul><h2 id="restrictions-on-the-use-of-program-funds" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#restrictions-on-the-use-of-program-funds"><span>Restrictions on the Use of Program Funds</span></a></h2>',6),c={href:"https://github.com/campus-experts/being-an-expert/issues/447#issuecomment-422042154",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=e("p",null,"The use of GitHub's funding for the purchase of prizes/awards may result in the revocation of sponsorship, and potential exclusion from future funding opportunities.",-1),g=e("h2",{id:"guidelines",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#guidelines"},[e("span",null,"Guidelines")])],-1),f=e("p",null,"As mentioned above, the budget for the program is not unlimited.
