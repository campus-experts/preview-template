languages, something likean assembly language for functional programming. It is actually a very simple

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files(codes) , It gives a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should there be a need to.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>Students become fairly nervous when making the big transition from school to starting work mostly because they’re unsure of what to expect. This workshop was aimed at de-mystifying these uncertainties especially for students pursuing cyber security majors. The focus was on: how to apply for internships, what to expect in technical interviews and what technologies and/or skills should one possess before starting their cyber security internship.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>Getting into cloud computing or the DevOps world is made easy by various cloud providers. For instance, Amazon Web Services provides access to AWS Educate to learn both the fundamentals of the cloud and AWS cloud services specifics, and Google provides access to Qwiklabs to learn all about the cloud and Google Cloud Platform cloud services specifics. Microsoft provides access to Microsoft Learn to do the same as others provided. The Linux Foundation has courses and training on cloud native paths and so on. There are other learning platforms outside the provider platforms. KodeCloud, ACloud, and others are also a place to leverage cloud technology knowledge.
Diving into all of the above-mentioned platforms may be very tedious and difficult without the knowledge of the basics. To find the cloud journey more interesting, one needs to have in their toolkits the basics to be discussed in this article. Don’t misunderstand this, jumping this will not hinder you from learning on those platforms. But it’s worth knowing that all these platforms are like an ocean to learn on and an ocean that can easily drone beginners and starters without the full knowledge of basics and fundamentals. My exploration of those platforms made it a choice for me to support people like me to learn the right way and show them what it is necessary to have as a pre-requisite.
The following are the basics you need to have as a person planning to start a cloud engineering journey.</p>

Connectivity between networks, both on Local Area Network (LAN) and the internet at large, are managed and controlled by the idea of computer networking. Networking is a field in Information Technology (IT) that ensures the interconnectivity between and among networks. It ensures that the broadcasting of packet data (message, data) is an easy and achievable process. The connectivity that ensures data movement is made possible through the concept of this discourse - ”ROUTING”. Routing is the selection of a path or route to be followed by a particular data packet (data or message or information) that is being shared over a network.
Keywords
Router: A device that is capable of transferring data from the source address to the destination address
Packet data: This is the data or information or message being shared or transferred over a network. In this discussion, we shall be using the three words interchangeably.
Protocols: Set of rules or guidelines that governs data transmission over a network. It is a standard that must be followed by nodes (computer) on a network to be able to communicate properly.
Node: Individual devices or PCs on the network.
Hops: Movement of data packets through the routers result to hop. And the number of networks the data packet passes is called hop counts.
IP: Stands for Internet Protocol which delivers packets to the right computers. It is of two versions. The IPv4 and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 4 and 6)
Autonomous System: A network or group of networks being managed and controlled by a single enterprise or operator.

      </h3>
      <p><p>My main motive to become a campus expert at GitHub was to conduct events that the community at IIT Mandi had never seen before. Looking at the success FrostHack had, I can say that at least this goal of mine was fully accomplished. Given the pandemic situation, when everyone was at their homes with no hope of coming back to campus, conducting such a large hackathon that too, in online mode was a humongous task. But, given the efforts of the complete organizing team mentors and and our amazing participants it was a huge success.
This year we had over 1500+ registrations from 300+ different colleges and finally over 250+ Project Submissions. In our Discord server alone, now we have a community of over 1200 people.</p>

      <p><p>Edgar Mosso: I am a data scientist who is passionate about transforming reality with data. I really believe in progress based on analysing and understanding everything we can sense in our real world; and markets, financial services and social media are not the exception.
As an engineer I’ve been working with two banks since I started my professional career three years ago giving me some experience to understand a little more about data sciense itself.
I believe there is no key to success but learning as much as you can from everything you get in touch with can give you a very large advantage from those who are not willing to learn.</p>

Introduced them to the student developer pack and introduced them to education[dot]github[themagicalcharacter]com.
All in all, it was a great experience, got to learn a lot, found rooms of improvement :sparkles:</p>

      <p><p>This post is more a question then an answer.
I started recently working on a Python project, I loved the language. But as a person coming from Java World, the uncertainty (I call it like this) in the use of variables and sometimes the ambiguity in its errors is killing me. Of course probably this is happening ‘cuz I’m still a newbie in this beautiful world.
Now to go to our point. I needed to open a file that contains a JSON List</p>

Last year on December, I had a chance to mentor and talk at one of India’s largest open source event, <a href="https://hackference.in">Hackference</a>. The entire event consisted of DevRelConf and a general Hackathon. This was my first time attending a DevRelConf, and you might be wondering “what the heck is a DevRelConf anyway?”. Well, the name stands for Developer Relations Conference, as it may sound the event is aimed at assimilation of developer advocates and Evangelists of multiple organizations, sharing their knowledge and experiences to help communities grow. The concept of Developer Relations is quite new, where in the name <em>Developer Relations, Developer Evangelism and Developer Advocacy</em> comes under a common name of <strong>Developer Marketing</strong>.</p>

I gave a talk on tensorflow.js. I also conducted a hands-on workshop on tensorflow.js, which gave an opportunity to the attendees to build a machine learning web app.

      <p><p>Hackathons are fun, interactive and social gathering of like minded people who spend their time hacking together pieces of code to build something cool. For years hackathons have been known for huge cash prizes for winners. Sometimes the numbers are just humungous. Having a huge cash prize means, attracting more hackers, giving rise to a complete competitive enviroment. So here’s a question? Being a complete beginner to the entire programming thingy and having to compete with highly skilled people (There drowns half of your motivation) just to end up comparing yourself and having that thought of “Am I really cut out for this?” might always get a “nay!” from our young lads.</p>

      <p><p>Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
Under this initiative I conducted a workshop in my college. During this event we talked about Open Source. The attendees got to know about the benefits of contributing to open source. We also had a hands-on workshop on Git, which gave an opportunity for the students to learn about how to contribute to open source projects. The students were then encouraged to send at least 3 PR.</p>

Connectivity between networks, both on Local Area Network (LAN) and the internet at large, are managed and controlled by the idea of computer networking. Networking is a field in Information Technology (IT) that ensures the interconnectivity between and among networks. It ensures that the broadcasting of packet data (message, data) is an easy and achievable process. The connectivity that ensures data movement is made possible through the concept of this discourse - ”ROUTING”. Routing is the selection of a path or route to be followed by a particular data packet (data or message or information) that is being shared over a network.
Keywords
Router: A device that is capable of transferring data from the source address to the destination address
Packet data: This is the data or information or message being shared or transferred over a network. In this discussion, we shall be using the three words interchangeably.
Protocols: Set of rules or guidelines that governs data transmission over a network. It is a standard that must be followed by nodes (computer) on a network to be able to communicate properly.
Node: Individual devices or PCs on the network.
Hops: Movement of data packets through the routers result to hop. And the number of networks the data packet passes is called hop counts.
IP: Stands for Internet Protocol which delivers packets to the right computers. It is of two versions. The IPv4 and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 4 and 6)
Autonomous System: A network or group of networks being managed and controlled by a single enterprise or operator.

For instance, Amazon Web Services provides access to AWS Educate to learn both the fundamentals of the cloud and AWS cloud services specifics, and Google provides access to Qwiklabs to learn all about the cloud and Google Cloud Platform cloud services specifics. Microsoft provides access to Microsoft Learn to do the same as others provided. The Linux Foundation has courses and training on cloud native paths and so on. There are other learning platforms outside the provider platforms. KodeCloud, ACloud, and others are also a place to leverage cloud technology knowledge.
Diving into all of the above-mentioned platforms may be very tedious and difficult without the knowledge of the basics. To find the cloud journey more interesting, one needs to have in their toolkits the basics to be discussed in this article. Don’t misunderstand this, jumping this will not hinder you from learning on those platforms. But it’s worth knowing that all these platforms are like an ocean to learn on and an ocean that can easily drone beginners and starters without the full knowledge of basics and fundamentals. My exploration of those platforms made it a choice for me to support people like me to learn the right way and show them what it is necessary to have as a pre-requisite.
