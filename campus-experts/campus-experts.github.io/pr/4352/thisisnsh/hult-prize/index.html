<p><em>Any comments on the venue, did it work well? Include links to the location if you like.</em>
This is the first ever global event that has ever been organized in our college. So for holding all the participants I had to reserve - One Auditorium and 2 conference halls. These 3 places worked perfectly and I divided the organizing teams to manage the event successfully.</p>

No, the schedule did not changed. All 2 days were planned nicely by all of us</p>

The swags were sent before time by GitHub Team. Everything went well.</p>
