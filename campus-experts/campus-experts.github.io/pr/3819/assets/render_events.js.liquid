We'll have a workshops in-which students will learn how they can help with these projects. One cool thing we'll do is work together on a project called "UniLife Connect" It's like a diary for our college events, but online so everyone can see what's happening at our university. Right now, we don't have anything like it. We'll also teach students how to use free open-source tools instead of paying for expensive ones. They'll understand why open source is valuable and even get ideas for making their own open source projects.",
